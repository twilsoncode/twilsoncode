# Hi

I'm Tim, I enjoy programming in Python and using it in a wide range of projects. My main enjoyment is using it in scientific applications in making things. I am interested in learning about the use of Python in Aritificial Intelligence and Machine Learning too.

This is a repository for the projects I have completed to date in chronological order (there is a repository for each project)
- Exercises from the book [Python Machine Learning for Beginners](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Machine-Learning-Beginners-Scikitlearn/dp/1734790156/ref=asc_df_1734790156/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=463092568931&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11301490650353943517&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1006548&hvtargid=pla-1013663454442&psc=1&mcid=0aaf1a9cc94f37e78ac6726eda43edd8&th=1&psc=1)
- The Amino Insight desktop application
- The [Amino Insight web application](https://aminoinsight.com/)
- A failed attempt at re-creating the [AlphaFold AI protein structure predictor](https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphafold/)
- A program for HÃ¼ckel Molecular Orbital calculations that works for any conjugated hydrocarbon molecule
